# Applied Data Analytics training program – High Need Populations (2017)

The [Coleridge Initiative](coleridgeinitiative.org)'s Applied Data Analytics training program focused on high need populations.

## Class Overview and Projects

The Coleridge Initiative Applied Data Analytics Training Program is designed to equip public policy professionals with advanced computer science and data science skills. The program provides a hands-on introduction to data analytics topics ranging from basic SQL and Python coding to running and interpreting machine learning models. Application to real-world issues is key to the organization of the program – the present Training Program addressed High Need Populations.

During the program, participants were grouped into teams in which they scoped and executed a project related to Criminal Justice and Recidivism, Access to Transportation, and/or Social Benefits. All teams presented their results on February 7th and 8th, 2018. Project themes included:
- **Predicting Recidivism**: Using machine learning techniques, several teams identified key factors in re-incarceration using social, economic, and demographic variables. The results provide valuable insight for targeted interventions on high need individuals.
- **Impact of Social Benefits**: Other groups measured whether TANF benefits have a positive impact on the economic or criminal outcomes of those who enroll. These projects provide quantifiable impact evaluations of the policy, according to several outcome measures.
- **Access to Public Services**: Another series of projects looked at the access of high-need populations to public services. By visualizing the distribution of transportation, public health, or education, these projects are relevant to decision-makers in charge of territorial organization.

## Data Available for Class

For both class notebooks and team projects, participants of the Applied Data Analytics Training Program have access to several datasets, including confidential micro-data hosted on the secure Administrative Data Research Facility platform. The datasets available for the High Need Populations Training Program included:
- Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) data
- Illinois Department of Employment Services (IDES) data
- Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) data: exit data, parole data
- Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program data
- Census LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)
